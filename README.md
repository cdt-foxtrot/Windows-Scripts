# Windows-Scripts

These 5 Windows scripts currently only work for local machines.  
They perform the following functions:  

1. **Downloads** – Installs important features, files, and applications.  
2. **Backup** – Backs up WinRM and IIS configurations.  
3. **Firewall** – Restricts traffic to only allow HTTP/HTTPS.  
4. **Usermgmt** – Changes passwords and secures users for local machines.  
5. **IIS** – Secures IIS and FTP sites.
